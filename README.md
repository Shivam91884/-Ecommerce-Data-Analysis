# Ecommerce Data Analysis

Welcome to the **Ecommerce Data Analysis** project! This repository contains an analysis of e-commerce data using Python and various libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and insights generation.

## üìÅ **Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing and extracting insights from an e-commerce dataset. The analysis covers various aspects, such as sales trends, customer behavior, product performance, and more. The objective is to provide actionable insights that can help improve business strategies and understand key metrics.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tools & Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Core programming language for the analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for running and visualizing code (`Ecommerce.ipynb`).
- **Libraries**:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **MySQL Connector**: For connecting and fetching data from a MySQL database.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data handling.

## üìä **Analysis Performed**
The project includes the following types of analysis:
- **Sales Analysis**: Monthly and annual sales trends, revenue calculations, and identifying peak sales periods.
- **Customer Analysis**: City-wise customer distribution, identification of frequent customers, and customer order patterns.
- **Product Analysis**: Best-selling products, product categories performance, and stock levels.
- **Order Analysis**: Order status trends, popular payment modes, and high/low demand products.
- **Geographical Analysis**: City-specific product popularity and customer distribution.

## üìë **Project Structure**
- **`Ecommerce.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for the e-commerce data.
- **Data Files**: The dataset files (if available) used for analysis.
- **README.md**: This documentation file.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**
To run the project:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Shivam91884/Ecommerce-Data-Analysis.git
  
2. Install the required libraries:
